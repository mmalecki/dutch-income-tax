# dutch-income-tax
Estimate Dutch income tax the UNIX way.

*Disclaimer*: This project was a just a semi-useful, quick hack to learn more
Haskell. [@ArdaXi](https://github.com/ardaxi) states that this estimator
is very basic and could be completely wrong. I believe him, he's good with
numbers. Do not use this for actually calculating your tax.

```
$ npm -g install dutch-income-tax
$ dutch-income-tax
1000
-100
1200
^D
122.85000000000001
```

Pipe to it from your invoice management system or whatever.
